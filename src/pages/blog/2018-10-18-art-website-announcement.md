Hello again. This has been a long time coming, and yet, a little too soon. This is an announcement for my shot at self-employment; An online gallery and store for my art. I've been working on this heavily over the past month, and today, despite it not being fully realized, I deployed it from my hard drive to the web. And now I can show you all.



 This is a milestone, from here the hard part is over. All that's left - aside from many little tweaks - is to fill it with paintings. Doing this is a win-win for me. So what if I don't sell anything? I've built the best possible site I could at the time, something I could show to an emplyor, and I have a place to document and store my progress. This is my virtual archive, a gallery of my own. But selling some would be good too. 



What would an online shop, built by the cheapest person alive, be built like? It will cost me $20 a year to run (domain name). That's it. From a technical standpoint, the store is very unique. It is built with the JAMstack, a very modern development architecture that has come full circle from the horrendous web stacks of today. My store will have potentially 10,000 items in it and it: Has. No. Database. Is this a battle-tested way of doing things? No. Does it allow for real-time site updates? No. Is it free to host? Yes. Technical post on its development coming in the late future.



As far as this providing self-employment, I've turned my hobby into something that can passively make me money (not counting the actual painting for the passively part). Whatever business I get from this is a by-product, not a goal - but a by-product of my hobby. And that's the lowest stress, easy way things can go as far as I can see. Actually selling anything will depend on my work being any good, SEO, social media following, and a lot of other things. But hey, how could you not like doing something and try to get more out of it?



And now for why I keep saying I've deployed this early. One: I was getting impatient, and two: I'm starting a full-time flower picking job in a field for about eight weeks. I'll keep you waiting for a little longer Ra, its time to get some windows in the studio.

Anyway, things to add (In order of time):

*  Mobile support (please not test that now, its embarrassing)
* Working Paypal (no, you can't actually buy anything. It will work though trust me)
* Dedicated background paintings and SVG art for landing and around the site
* Animate those SVGs
* Blog integration for each art pice. Elaron means beautiful, this next part will be called Archive/Library

I guess I should probably give you a link incase you want to take a look. Here you go: <https://elaron.art/>

If you have any feed back or ideas for this, I want to hear you.



I'll be back in a white.
