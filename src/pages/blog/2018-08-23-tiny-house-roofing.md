Twenty minutes before the materials for my roof arrived, it abruptly started pouring down with hail. This was the first real downpour we've had, aside from some drizzle. A rush to get it all in undercover revealed that, though we were told the order was ready, the roofing screws had not arrived. After some smaller jobs were compleated (spouting, stopping and sanding) we prepared. 



We stacked all the colour steel sheets together flush, marked out the screw placement, and drilled all the holes in one go. This is a very accurate and time effective way to pre-drill and ensures that every sheet has a hole in the same place. This also means that any hole placed wrong will affect every sheet. Thankfully, not only did all the holes (roughly) line up, but we had just enough roof screws to tack the steel sheets down firmly until more arrive.
