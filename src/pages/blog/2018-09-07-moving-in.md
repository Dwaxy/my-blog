The first night was very cold. But I was warm. In my house. That I built. Laying in bed thinking “This is nice”. 

let's catch up, lots of small jobs not worth writing about on their own but make or break the build, like oh I don’t know - the _door_. Roof flashings too.

But the big thing here is the move. You see, within a week, we would have a new tenant moving on the property. Moving into the house I was staying in. So it made the tiny house liveable or be homeless (Not true but I like to be dramatic). Luckily it was not too much work to get to this stage. The day I “moved out” was the evening -

that's better. The evening I walked out with a torch and a hot water bottle and crawled into bed. It is surprising how much light there is out at nighttime though. Rigging a makeshift blind (I pillaged a rug from the shed) was a top priority the next morning. It seems to be working, let's see how it does on night three. Me from the future, night three was fine.  I beat the final boss in Hyper Light Drifter <https://youtu.be/nFJ73LLVSS4>.

I have a strong sense of ending sitting here writing this. Its \*far\* from over, but I’m in it now. The rush is done, I’m in. It's time to look at finding some work. Other things that need doing come to mind. I want to get stuck into making my site to sell my art - painting more as well. And writing on here. I do regret not putting more time into documenting and sharing ideas about the tiny house here. But they serve their purpose as they are. A reminder to me, as I found I could only really look at this project as another building job (most of) the time. But what I can do is look at it as the awesome thing in hindsight, and that's what these short bear bones update posts have done.

As for now, whenever I'm inside I get random outbursts of tehe. Its embarrassing to admit, but I feel obliged to show you what I mean. [https://youtu.be/Pjp__7g2oPk](https://youtu.be/Pjp__7g2oPk)
