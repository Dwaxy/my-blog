This was a long time in the making. When I was younger I remember the day me building a tiny house was mentioned, and the idea hit home instantly. It wasn't till much later I started to think it as an idea I would actually carry out. Somewhere along the line, it became just something I was going to do one day. Years past, and suddenly it went from aspiration to something that the sooner I did the better.

But there is always something you need to do first, isn't there. In my case, it was the family project of building our poll shed. Then, building my sisters tiny house - that one went by fast. Things really started to get agonising slow when all of a sudden, parents decided they were going to build a cabin. Maybe I'll post about that some other time - it deserves a post of its own. After all this, my tiny house way starting to feel like an anti-climatic boss from a video game with tough and steady difficulty progression. 

Here's a picture of me not looking too happy about the waiting:

The cabin was built and we're all very happy with it. But alas, now the old house needs renovating - and the shed is a mess! The funny thing is, despite all that, when the day finally came to dig my pile holes, there was no feeling like "this is it, this is the day". It felt like just another job. Don't get me wrong - it was relieving, and I still enjoyed every minute. I guess what I'm trying to say is, it felt normal. We never imagine your dreams in life to feel normal when we act them out.

On the flip side of that, my dream is my normal. How awesome is that?

Do you see the madness in my eyes?
