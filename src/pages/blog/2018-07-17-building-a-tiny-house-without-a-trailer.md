There's a saying among builders:

> _Its good to be above ground._

Its because even the builders would rather pay someone else then go digging pile holes for the foundation. That, and painting (so I hear). Then there is the mixing concrete, and then _somehow_ getting the bearers vertical. It feels like the building never starts till that is over. 

You may hope that it might be a little different when doing it for a tiny house project, but if your going without a trailer: nope. Its back to good old basic building foundation.

You're going to need to brush up on your foundation skills. Thankfully, its straightforward. The complicated parts are the profiles (those braced frames you see in the image), they are used to mark the build's footprint, so then you can mark the holes. Then, its just digging.

A bit of digging. I like to complain about digging holes a lot to the point where I annoy even me. But I've gotten so good at it, I made them too big. So big, I had my body up to my waist down each one, scooping out dirt with an ice cream container. The blood rushing to my head and struggling to get out was kind of funny, but when I saw the volume of concrete the four main holes swallowed: _shudder._ I knew this was not going to be as dirt cheap as I hoped.

We ended up getting another load of mix, coming to a total under $100 NZD. Now thats still a _very_ cheap trailer.

Now now, I know you can only go so far with it stuck in the ground. 

**"But you can't _move_ it!"** I'm not going to. Were you? Well, not the "trailer" anyway. Go and read "Building a tiny house with a trailer.

**"It can be worth saving, you can go bigger in NZ if its classed as a vehicle."** Sure, if you want to travel. But you see, I'm a broke ass starving artist. And I'm impatient.

Going with a fixed foundation is actually a great compromise to cost and both of these questions. You see, a tiny house is, well, tiny. **If you bolt the damn thing on, you can bolt it off again.** And put it on a truck you hired. Then bolt it on to a new foundation. Someplace else. For less than $100 NZD (I don't know about the truck part). If you dig it yourself.

If your spending your time to build a thing, you may as well be cheap about it. I'm going to take that too far some day, just you wait.
