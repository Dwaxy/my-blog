The last few weeks have been full on. I've clad the tiny house in ecoply for bracing, and we've installed rafters. The joists went on today. I've been feeling really good about it; though its been tough finding time for other things. Like documenting. Always glad I found time to take some pictures though, this time they came out rather well.

To bring you up to speed a little, here is a picture of the ecoply on. While being a definite stage, its really not that exciting to read about. So I didn't make a post on it. Though I might do one on ecoply as a bracing for a tiny house.

The most exiting part about framing the roof - aside from getting closer to keeping the floor dry - is getting a final idea of how big the space feels. With tiny homes, as you frame it, it starts to feel smaller and smaller. There are few dimensions you can really upsize in a tiny home. But there is one: up! I'm (bragging) lucky that my height turned out about right, as it wasn't even planned. I just went to the max height and hoped it would look good.

Here is a picture of the roof height at my eye level. Keep in mind I'm 6 foot tall.

Minus the thickness of the coming ceiling (10 - 15 mill at most), thats pretty nifty I'd say.

It was pretty fun to saw off the excess joists too.

 As you can see I'm rather pleased with myself.

Finale picture of the roof as it stands.
