I don't know how you found your way here, but you have. For some reason you thought this obscure site worth clicking on, and for that, thanks. What you've found is my little place to write about things - primarily my tiny house build, and things like it. Things that I want to remember, or shout into the void of the web about. And things I find interesting.

I paint - sometimes I even think of it as art - and I'm a Web Developer. I'm also quite dyslexic, which begs the question why there is a point in this when I can't spell. I do it because I think its something I find meaningful; I'll be talking about those too.

I'm sure you'll find all sorts of things here, but what I know you will find is my thoughts on painting, some how to's on web development, and complete documentation of my tiny house project, and others like it. I'd be really happy if you found this place interesting, or even helpfull. I've certainty found places like this to be.

Hope you stick around. Enjoy your stay.
