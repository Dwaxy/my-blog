Standing the frames is the part of any build that looks and feels like accelerated progress. For me, it was not only that. Standing my frames made this project feel real. 

We have been prefabbing frames over the past weeks. My excuse for not posting has been that building framing is really straightforward, and not very interesting. But standing them is.

The process of finishing and then standing framing is a euphoric feeling for anyone when it is for their own home.

In the end, dad and I just stood them up. It was really quite simple. We stood the front first, and braced it to the subfloor joists. We plumed the sides off than, and then the back wall off that too. And then it was up, I had my first look of the interior and exterior scope of my place.

This was the moment I'd been waiting for to see if the interior design I had in mind would, well, fit. Thankfully it seems like it will. Though its going to be _cozy_ I had a wave of new ideas and possibilities. Being in the three dimensional, to scale is the only way to really get an accurate assessment of what you can do. I saw that I have more room on the walls for art than I thought, but my floor space would be crowded if I added a small kitchen. I've been gleefully contemplating angles for projector and computer screens from different places, and - what I think to be - a very clever bed and lounge area that will also act as my mass storage. My windows are also looking to be very good for the current location. Though expensive, the larger size will not make the house feel closed, but it will open. Combined with my french door I have stored in the shed, the house should open right out into a deck and have a direct view of the torlesse gap.
